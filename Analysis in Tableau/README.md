# Mercedes Benz Car Model Analysis using Tableau Dashboard
<br>

This visualization will explore every attribute of a dataset and also an important variables which go into determining a Mercedes Benz model automobile. As the name implies, visualizations allow us to gain a better understanding of the data. Hence, for better comprehenstion of our data we will study the statistical features of this data, generate visualisations, and test hypotheses throughout this stage.

#  Conclusion


<br>

The deduction and statistical analysis determined with the full consideration of metrics of Mercedes Model cars using the dataset. The notebook have explored Transmission, Miles/gallon, Mileage and road tax metrics for better comprehension of our dataset.  
<br>
1. For those who want to buy a car for travel or daily use, the miles per gallon number should be greater than 30 mpg.
2. Mileage is another element that influences a vehicle's fuel usage. The cost of maintaining a car is determined by its mileage.
3. Manual transmissions have more gears and a simpler design, making them lighter.
4. Diesel engines are restricted for vehicles that travel often, such as trucks, buses, and off-road vehicles, due to higher greenhouse gas emissions.
